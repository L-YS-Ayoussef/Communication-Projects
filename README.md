# Communication Projects

## 🌍 Overview

This repository contains a collection of communication systems projects implemented in `Python` and `MATLAB`. The focus is on building, simulating, and analyzing different communication techniques and concepts in a structured, hands-on way.

Each project lives in its own folder with its own `README.md`, code, and assets.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1️⃣ AM Modulation Techniques in MATLAB (DSB-LC, DSB-SC, SSB)
**Folder:** `AM-Modulation-Techniques-in-MATLAB-DSB-LC-DSB-SC-SSB-/`  
This project implements and visualizes three fundamental analog modulation schemes using `MATLAB`:

- Double Sideband Large Carrier (DSB-LC)
- Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC)
- Single Sideband (SSB)

The goal is to illustrate how each scheme works in the time and frequency domains, and to highlight the trade-offs in power and bandwidth efficiency.

### 2️⃣ Digital Filtering of an Audio Signal
**Folder:** `Digital-Filtering-of-an-Audio-Signal/`  
This project focuses on **digital FIR filtering of an audio signal** using `MATLAB`.  
It consists of two main parts:

- **Part 1:** Development of a filter design tool supporting:
  - Windowed Sinc FIR design
  - Least Squares (LS) FIR design
  - Weighted Least Squares (WLS) FIR design
- **Part 2:** Practical application of the tool to:
  - Analyze an audio file in time and frequency domains
  - Add a sinusoidal interference
  - Design FIR filters to suppress the interference
  - Evaluate the results by plotting spectra and listening to the processed audio

### 3️⃣ Multi-Floor Enterprise Network – Cisco Packet Tracer
**Folder:** `Multi-Floor-Enterprise-Network-Design-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-/`  
This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer** simulation of a three-floor enterprise/hotel network with multiple departments, VLANs, and core network services.

### 4️⃣ Pulse Modulation Techniques: PAM, Flat-Top-PAM, PWM, and PPM [Modulation-and-Demodulation]
**Folder:** `Pulse-Modulation-Techniques-PAM-Flat-Top-PAM-PWM-PPM-Modulation-and-Demodulation-/`  
This project implements and visualizes four fundamental pulse modulation techniques:

- Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)
- Flat-Top Pulse Amplitude Modulation (Flat-Top PAM)
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
- Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)

For each technique, both modulation and demodulation are demonstrated using simple mathematical models and signal plots.
